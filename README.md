# Senior Software Engineer

As a senior-level Full Stack Engineer with a strong background in frontend development, I bring extensive experience and expertise in building robust, scalable, and visually stunning web applications. Additionally, my passion for AI allows me to deliver creative and impactful solutions that push the boundaries of what is possible.

With a deep understanding of frontend technologies and best practices, I have successfully led projects and mentored junior developers to deliver exceptional products. Throughout my career, I have specialized in building complex user interfaces using modern frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js. I possess a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and am constantly exploring emerging technologies and tools to stay ahead of the curve.

In addition to my frontend skills, I have a strong background in backend development, including database design, API development, and server-side scripting. I am experienced in working with languages such as Node.js, Python, and Ruby on Rails, and have a thorough understanding of RESTful principles and microservices architecture.
